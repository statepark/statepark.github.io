        <p>My name is Laura Davis. It's nice to meet you. At this very exciting time of my life I am in transition from a career in hospitality to the world of web development. In my past roles I have directed a group of restaurants, operated an conference space with over 20 meeting rooms and 54,000sq ft of event space, managed events up to 14000 people. Most importantly, hired, managed and collaborated with incredible teams. In my hospitality career I also had the opportunity to oversee the implementation of web based applications in our work environments. Mostly these were designed to solve some business need, track customer engagement and occasionly improve a process. I was always curious to know the process behind their deveolpment and how they worked under the hood. 2020 gave me the opportunity to invest my curiosity and has led me on this learning journey to learn web development and become part of the technological process that shapes the way we work, do business and live our lives.Please feel free to reach out. I can be reached by <a href=mailto:laura.claire.davis@gmail.com>Email</a> or you can find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/laura-davis-734577aa">linkedin</a>. </p>
